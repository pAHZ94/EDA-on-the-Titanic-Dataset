# EDA-on-the-Titanic-Dataset
This repository contains the code and documentation for am Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titatic dataset.

## Overview
The sinking of the the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crews. This dataset contains information about the passenger aboard the Titanic, including various attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Content of the Analysis
Jupyter Notebook: The main analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook file named 'titanic-EDA.ipynb'.
Data: The dataset used for this analysis is provided in the 'data' directory.
Plots: All visualization generated during the analysis are included in the notebook.

# The Analysis answers the following questions:
* What is the most important factor in determining survival of the Titanic
incident?
* As stipulated in the movie, was the upper-class passengers given preference on
lifeboats?
* Were women and Children put first?
* Additional observations...
